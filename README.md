## Description

This is an old extension that I've decided to make source available. The frontend code was last altered on the 20th of May 2023.

Get the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/conversion-duck/gmmmfkfijagbmdcnbmfiehhdcpioipmm).

The extension gets hourly updated currency rates from my API. The current backend in production uses a serverless architecture with AWS instead of the Express server, but works very similarly still.
